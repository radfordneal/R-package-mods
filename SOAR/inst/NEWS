	o SOAR v0.99-10
	  - Minor bug fixed in Search() to use abbreviated names
	    for the home and R_HOME directories.

	o SOAR v0.99-8 and v0.99-9  Changes to v0.99-7
	  - the functions Ls, LsUtils and LsData are now allowed
	    aliases for Objects, ObjectsUtils and ObjectsData respectively,
	    purely as convencinces.
	  - lib.loc now has default "." rather than getwd().  This
	    overcomes a small bug if SOAR is being used at the
	    top level of an externam memory device on Windows,
	    e.g. at location E:\ on some machines.
	  - The vignette has been expanded to mention the 'track'
	    package of Tony Place as a possible alternative.  This
	    uses a different mechanism from that used by SOAR and
	    for some users might be more convenient.
	  - The Appendix on an earlier version, 'ASOR', has been
	    removed from the vigentte as now obsolete.  Users of ASOR
	    may obtain a copy of the old vignette from the mainteiner
	    if need be.

	o SOAR v0.99-7
	  - This release corrects several installation glitches
	    in versions 0.99-{4,5,6} and installs a correction
	    to the code that makes the package work on MAC OS X.
	    The correction is due to Prof. Brian Ripley.

	o SOAR v0.99-5.  Chanbes to V0.99-4:
	  - Minor change to vignette Makefile to conform to new
	    package protocols.  No change in functionality.

	o SOAR v0.99-4.  Changes to V0.99-3:
	  - minor bug fixes to StoreUtils, StoreData, and other
	    variants on the basic commands, which did not find the
	    right directory in some circumstances.

	o SOAR v0.99-3.  Changes to V0.99-2:
	  - minor coding change to the Data and Utils variants to
	    correct a potential enigma with their operation.
	    Invisible to the user.

	  - The function Search now has an argument, 'abbrev', which
	    allows the user to lop off the leading section of long
	    lib.loc names.  The default is not to lop.  See help file
	    for more details.

	  - Many changes, extensions and clarifications in the
	    vignette.  The most important change is a new sub-section
	    on "Windows and other traps" drawing attention to a
	    potential problem with SOAR on Windows filesystems caused
	    by file-name case insensitivity.  As the problem is not
	    exclusively confined to the Windows operating system, all
	    users are urged to read and take in this section before
	    proceeding to use the package.

	o SOAR v0.99-2 released on CRAn on 2001-04-07. This corrected
	  a potentially serious bug (on Windows alone) and required a
	  change to the encoding scheme.  Caches created either with
	  ASOR or with SOAR v0.99-1 are automatically converted to
	  meet the new file name encoding scheme

	o SOAR v0.99-1 released on CRAN on 2010-04-06. When used with
	  caches created with the unofficial pre-release 'ASOR'
	  package, these caches are (permanently) changed to meet the
	  new file name encoding scheme of SOAR
