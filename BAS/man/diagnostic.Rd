\title{BAS MCMC diagnostic plot}
\description{Function to help assess convergence of MCMC sampling for
  bas ojects.
}
\usage{diagnostics(obj, type=c("pip", "model"),  ...)
}
\arguments{

  \item{obj}{an object created by bas.lm or bas.glm}
  \item{type}{type of diagnostic plot.  If "pip" the marginal inclusion
  probabilities are used, while if "model", plot posterior model
  probabilities}
  \item{...}{additional graphics parameters to be passed to plot}
}
\value{a plot with of the marginal inclusion probabilities (pip) estimated
  by MCMC and renormalized marginal likelihoods times prior
  probabilities or model probabilities. 
}
\details{BAS calculates posterior model probabilites in two ways when
  method="MCMC".  The first is using the relative Monte Carlo frequencies of
  sampled models.  The second is to renormalize the marginal likelihood
  times prior probabilities over the sampled models.  If the markov
  chain has converged, these two quantities should be the same and fall
  on a 1-1 line.   If not, running longer may be required.  If the chain
  has not converged, the Monte Carlo frequencise may have have less bias,
  although may exhibit more variability.
