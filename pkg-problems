data.table 1.11.8

  Has horrible kludge to compensate for using SET_LENGTH, undone
  in version here.

  Has horrible kludges for its reference semantics, including
  checking whether modified object is named "*tmp*".  Not readily
  fixable.

RandomFields 2.0.71

  Abuses DUP=FALSE.

OData 0.6

  Maybe just a problem with http to https redirection for example?

TTR 0.23-0

  Maybe just a problem with http to https redirection for example?

arules

  Later versions incorporate internal subscript code - very bad idea!
  arulesSequences is incompatible with earlier arules due to wanting
  to use a logical subscript that isn't implemented.

copula 0.99-2

  Uses A..Z as a variable name.  So needs R_PARSE_DOTDOT=FALSE to
  install.
