Title: Sparse and Dense Matrix Classes and Methods
Author: Douglas Bates <bates@stat.wisc.edu> and Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>
Maintainer: Doug and Martin <Matrix-authors@R-project.org>
Description: Classes and methods for dense and sparse matrices and
    operations on them using Lapack and SuiteSparse.  
    Tests modified for pqR, with a timing-sensitive test removed, a
    precision-sensitive test modified, and a non-robust test modified
    as in later Matrix versions.
Depends: R (>= 2.15.0), stats, methods, utils, lattice
Imports: graphics, grid
Suggests: expm, MASS
Enhances: MatrixModels, graph, SparseM (>= 0.87), sfsmisc
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: no
LazyDataNote: no longer available, since we use data/*.R *and* our
        classes
