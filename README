This repository contains slightly modified versions of R packages for
inclusion in the package repository for pqR (see pqR-project.org).

These sometimes fix bugs, sometime make slight changes needed for pqR
compatibility, and sometimes just change the "Depends:" to allow use
with pqR (which has declared version 2.15.1, but many features from
later R Core vesions).
