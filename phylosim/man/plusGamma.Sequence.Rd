 \title{Sample the rate multiplier parameters of a Process from a Gamma distribution for a collection of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object}

 \description{
	Sample the rate multiplier parameters of a Process from a Gamma distribution for a collection of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object.

	The gamma distribution is discretized by calculating the means of the portions corresponding
	to the categories having equal probabilities. If the \code{ncat} argument is not numeric, the
	rates are sampled from the continuous gamma distribution.

	# create a sequence
	s<-NucleotideSequence(length=20)
	# attach a process
	p<-JC69()
	attachProcess(s,p)
	# get rate multipliers
	getRateMultipliers(s,p)	# the default value is 1.0
	# sample rate multipliers in range 1:5 from a discrete
	#gamma distribution with shape parameter 0.5
	plusGamma(s,p,0.5,1:5)
	# get rate multipliers
