 \title{Get the alignment stored in a PhyloSim object}

 \description{
	Get the alignment stored in a PhyloSim object.
 }

 \usage{
\method{getAlignment}{PhyloSim}(this, ...)
}

 \arguments{
 	\item{this}{A PhyloSim object.}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	The alignment as a matrix. Gap are represented by strings composed of dashes.
 }

 \examples{
	# Create a PhyloSim object.
	# Provide the phylo object
	# and the root sequence.
	sim<-PhyloSim(
		name="TinySim",
		phylo=rcoal(3),
		root.seq=NucleotideSequence(string="ATG",processes=list(list(JC69())))
	);
	# run the simulation
	Simulate(sim)
	# get the resulting aligment
	getAlignment(sim)
	# via virtual fileld:
	sim$alignment
