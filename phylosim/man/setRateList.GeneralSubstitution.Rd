 \title{Setting the rates for a GeneralSubstitution object}

 \description{
	Setting the rates for a GeneralSubstitution object.

	This method set the rates in the \emph{unscaled} Q  matrix based on the provided list containing even names
	and the associated rates. The rate must be specified for every event!
 }

 \usage{
\method{setRateList}{GeneralSubstitution}(this, value, ...)
}

 \arguments{
 	\item{this}{A GeneralSubstitution object.}
	\item{value}{A list with the events names and the associated rates.}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	The GeneralSubstitution object (invisible).
 }

 \examples{
	# create a GeneralSubstitution object
	# provide an Alphabet object and the rates
	p<-GeneralSubstitution(alphabet=BinaryAlphabet(), rate.list=list("1->0"=1,"0->1"=3))
	# get the event rates from the unscaled Q matrix
	getRateList(p)
	# get rates from the unscaled rate matrix via virtual field
	p$rateList
	# set rates in the unscaled rate matrix
	setRateList(p, list("0->1"=1,"1->0"=1))
	p$rateList
	# set rates in the unscaled rate matrix via virtual field
	p$rateList<-list("0->1"=3,"1->0"=1);
	# check the contenst of the associated QMatrix object
	summary(p$QMatrix)
