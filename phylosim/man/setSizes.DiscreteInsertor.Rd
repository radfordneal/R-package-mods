 \title{Set the sizes of the proposed insertions}

 \description{
       Set the sizes of the proposed insertions.
     
       The provided numeric vector is rounded.
 }

 \usage{
\method{setSizes}{DiscreteInsertor}(this, value, ...)
}

 \arguments{
       \item{this}{A DiscreteInsertor object.}
       \item{value}{A numeric vector.}
       \item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
       A vector of integers (invisible).
 }

 \examples{
       # create a DiscreteInsertor object
       i<-DiscreteInsertor(rate=1)
       # set insertion sizes    
       setSizes(i,c(1,2,3))
       # get insertion sizes
       getSizes(i)
       # set/get sizes via virtual field
       i$sizes<-1:10
       i$sizes
