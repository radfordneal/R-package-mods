 \title{Get the size of the acceptance window}

 \description{
	Get the size of the acceptance window

	This parameter determines the number of sites neighbouring the position (from left and right) of the insertion considered when accepting/rejecting
	a proposed insertion. The "insertion.tolerance" parameter is retrived from sites falling in the window specified by this parameter.
	The default value is 1, so the two neighbouring sites are considered by default.

 }
