 \title{Set the states of a collection of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object to undefined (NA)}

 \description{
	Set the states of a collection of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object to undefined (NA).
 }

 \usage{
\method{clearStates}{Sequence}(this, index, ...)
}

 \arguments{
 	\item{this}{A Sequence object.}
	\item{index}{An integer vector specifying a set of positions. It is set to 1:seq$length if omitted.}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	The Sequence object (invisible).
 }

 \examples{
	# create a nucleotide sequence
	s<-NucleotideSequence(string="ATGC")
	s
	# set states to NA in the range 2:3
	clearStates(s,2:3)
	s
	# set all states to NA
	clearStates(s)
	s
