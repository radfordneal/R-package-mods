 \title{Generate a Brownian path}

 \description{
	Generate a Brownian path.

	This method generates a Brownian path given the scale parameter a (determining "noisiness")
	and the vector p describing the trends. More useful as a static method.
 }

 \usage{
\method{BrownianPath}{BrownianInsertor}(this, p=NA, a=NA, ...)
}

 \arguments{
	\item{this}{A BrownianInsertor object.}
 	\item{p}{Path parameter (a numeric vector).}
 	\item{a}{Scale paramater (a numeric vector of length one).}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	A numeric vector.
 }

 \examples{
	path<-BrownianInsertor$BrownianPath(a=2,p=1:10);
	path
	plot(path)
 }
