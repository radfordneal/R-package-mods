 \title{Get the base frequency parameters}

 \description{
	Get the base frequency parameters.

	The order of the frequency parameters must match with the order of symbols
	in the NucleotideAlphabet objects. The K81 model has equal base frequencies.
 }

 \usage{
\method{getBaseFreqs}{K81}(this, ...)
}

 \arguments{
 	\item{this}{A K81 object.}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	A matrix containing the base frequency parameters.
 }

 \examples{
	# construct object
	p<-K81()
	# get base frequency parameters
	getBaseFreqs(p) # uniform
	# set/get base frequency parameters via virtual field
	p$baseFreqs # uniform
 }
