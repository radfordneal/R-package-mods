 \title{Get the states of a set of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object}

 \description{
	Get the states of a set of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object.

 }

 \usage{
\method{getStates}{Sequence}(this, index, ...)
}

 \arguments{
 	\item{this}{A Sequence object.}
 	\item{index}{An integer vector specifying a set of positions.
	It is set to 1:seq$length if omitted.}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	A character vector.
 }

 \examples{
	# create a sequence object
	s<-Sequence(alphabets=list(NucleotideAlphabet()),string="AATTGCCCCCTTGG")
	# get all Site states
	getStates(s)
	# get the states for a collection of sites
	getStates(s,c(1:3,5,8))
	# get states via virtual field
	s$states
 }
