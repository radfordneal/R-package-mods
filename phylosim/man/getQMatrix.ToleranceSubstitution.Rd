 \title{Get the QMatrix object aggregated by a ToleranceSubstitution object}

 \description{
	Get the QMatrix object aggregated by a ToleranceSubstitution object.

	This method is mostly used internally.
 }

 \usage{
\method{getQMatrix}{ToleranceSubstitution}(this, ...)
}

 \arguments{
 	\item{this}{A ToleranceSubstitution object.}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	A QMatrix object.
 }

 \examples{
	# create a ToleranceSubstitution object
	# provide an Alphabet object and the rates
	p<-ToleranceSubstitution(alphabet=BinaryAlphabet(), rate.list=list("1->0"=1,"0->1"=1))
	# get the QMatrix object
	getQMatrix(p)
	# get the QMatrix object via virtual field
	q<-p$qMatrix
	# tweak with the QMatrix
	setRate(q,"0->1",2)
	# set a new QMatrix for p
	setQMatrix(p,q)
	summary(p)
	# set new QMatrix via virtual field
	setRate(q,"1->0",2)
	p$qMatrix<-q
	summary(p)
 }
