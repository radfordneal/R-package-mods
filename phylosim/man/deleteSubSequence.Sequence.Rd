 \title{Delete a collection of sites aggregated by a Sequence object}

 \description{
	Delete a collection of sites aggregated by a Sequence object.
 }

 \usage{
\method{deleteSubSequence}{Sequence}(this, index, ...)
}

 \arguments{
 	\item{this}{A Sequence object.}
	\item{index}{An index vector specifying a collection of sites to be deleted. It is set to 1:seq$length if omitted.}
 	\item{...}{Not used.}
 }

 \value{
 	Invisible TRUE or errror.
 }

 \examples{
	# create a nucleotide sequence
	s<-NucleotideSequence(string="ATATATATATATATAT")
	# delete sites 2, 4 and 6
	deleteSubSequence(s,c(2,4,6))
	s
	# delete sites in the range 3:6
	deleteSubSequence(s,3:6)
	s
