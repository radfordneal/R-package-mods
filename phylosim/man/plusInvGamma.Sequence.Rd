 \title{Sample the rate multiplier parameters of a Process from an I+Gamma distribution for a collection of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object}

 \description{
	Sample the rate multiplier parameters of a Process from an I+Gamma distribution for a collection of Site objects aggregated by a Sequence object.

	The gamma distribution is discretized by calculating the means of the portions corresponding
	to the categories having equal probabilities. If the \code{ncat} argument is not numeric, the
	rates are sampled from the continuous gamma distribution.
